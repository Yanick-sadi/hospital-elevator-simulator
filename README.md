# Hospital Elevator Simulator
This is a simple Python program that simulates a patient’s journey through different stages of a hospital visit. It moves a patient from reception through to triage, doctor assessment, and a decision point where the patient is either discharged or hospitalized.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates:

Use of Python's random and time libraries

Conditional statements and loops

Simulation of real-world stages with brief delays

## How It Works
The program goes through each stage with a 1-second delay, simulating the time taken for each step in the hospital. At the final stage, a random outcome is generated to determine if the patient is discharged or admitted for further treatment.

## Stages in the Simulation
Reception: The patient arrives at the hospital.

Triage: The patient is evaluated for urgency.

Doctor: The patient consults with a doctor.

Hospitalization Decision: Based on the doctor’s assessment, the patient is either discharged or hospitalized.

## Running the Program
Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/).

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
   python hospital_elevator_simulator.py
